    <p><q>Any fool can write code that a
        computer can understand. Good programmers
        write code that humans can understand.</q> -Martin Fowler</p>

        best practices is keeping your code clean and readable. imagine
        you are writing your code not just for computers but for humans 
        as well. This will not only improve your coding skills but also make maintenance
        easier.</p>

    <p>Here's an example of clean code:</p>
    <pre><code>function calculateArea(radius) {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;    
    }</code></pre>
    <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd> to save your work regularly.</p>
    <p>Sample output: <samp>Area claculated: 78.54</samp> (assuming radius is 5).</p>
