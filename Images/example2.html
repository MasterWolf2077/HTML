    <h2>img Tag and Attributes</h2>
    <img src="/uploads/media/default/0001/03/mountain_landscape.jpg" alt="Mountain landscape" width="340" height="250">

    <h2>Image Location</h2>
    <h3>Relative Path</h3>      <!--A relative path is a path that starts from the directory of the HTML file. For example: -->
    <img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="A picture">

    <h3>Absolute Path</h3>      <!--An absolute path is a path that starts from the root directory of the website. For example: -->
    <img src="https://example.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="A picture">

    <h2>Responsive Images: the srcset and sizes Attributes</h2>
    <!--The srcset attribute allows you to specify a list of image files with different resolutions, sizes, and formats. -->
    <!--The sizes attribute specifies the size of the image container in which the image will be displayed. In other words, 
    it tells the browser how much screen space the image will occupy on different devices. -->
    <!--By using srcset and sizes together, you can create images that are optimized for different devices and screen sizes. -->
    <img src=sunflowers.jpg"
     alt="Sunflowers in the sunset"
     srcset="sunflowers-small.jpg 480w,     
             sunflowers-medium.jpg 800w,
             sunflowers-large.jpg 1200w"
     sizes="(max-width: 480px) 95vw,
            (max-width: 800px) 45vw,
            30vw">

    <h2>Other Image-Specific Attributes: border, hspace, vspace, and align</h2>
    <h3>The border Attribute</h3>   <!--The border attribute specifies the width of the border around the image.  -->
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example image" border="2">
    <h3>The hspace and vspace Attributes</h3>   <!--The hspace and vspace attributes specify the horizontal and vertical space around the image, respectively.  -->
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example image" hspace="10" vspace="10">

    <h1>Hyperlinks</h1>

    <h2>The a Tag and the href Attribute</h2>
    <a href="https://www.example.com/">Visit our website</a>

    <h2>Internal Links</h2> <!--The <a> tag primarily relies on the href attribute, which specifies the destination of the link. -->
    <a href="https://example.com/page.html">Link to Page</a>    <!--the full address of the page (absolute URL). -->
    <a href="/page.html">Link to Page</a>   <!--the relative URL which only includes the path to the page,
     and creates a link to the page.html file in the same directory as the current page. -->

    <h2>Anchor Links</h2>
    <!--To create a link like this, you’re going to need the id attribute and the # symbol. Here’s how to do it:

1.Add the id attribute to an HTML element on the page that you want to link to. For example, if you want to link to
 an <h2> element with the content “Section 1”, you can do the following: <h2 id="section-1">Section 1</h2>.
2.Then, create a link that points to this anchor by adding the # symbol followed by the id to the href attribute
 of an <a> tag, like this: <a href="#section-1">Go to Section 1</a>. -->

    <h2>External Links</h2>     <!--To create an external link, you need to specify the full URL of the page, website,
                                 or resource that you want to link to.  -->
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
    <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example Website</a>     <!--It's important to note that because external links take users away from your website, 
                                                                                you should ensure that they open in a new window or tab using the target attribute.  -->
    <!--The target="_blank" attribute will open the linked page in a new tab or window, allowing users to easily return to your website. 
    The target="_self" attribute will open the link in the same window. -->

    <h2>Email links</h2>    <!--To create an email link, you can use the mailto protocol followed by the email address that you want to link to. -->
    <a href="mailto:info@example.com">Email Us</a>

    <h2>Telephone links</h2>    <!--Similarly, to create a telephone link, you can use the tel protocol followed by the telephone number that you want to link to.  -->
    <a href="tel:123-456-7890">Call us at 123-456-7890</a>

    <h2>The download Attribute</h2>     <!--The download attribute specifies that the target of the link should be downloaded rather than navigated to.
     The attribute value can be used as the default filename that the downloaded file will be saved as. -->
    <a href="https://example.com/document.pdf" download="my-document.pdf">Download my document</a>

    <h2>The rel Attribute</h2>  <!--The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the target document. It can be used to indicate
     that the target document is a stylesheet, a parent document, or a part of a series, among other things. -->
    <a href="https://example.com/stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet">Link to stylesheet</a>

    <h2>The title Attribute</h2>    <!--The title attribute provides additional information about an element, enhancing the user's understanding and interaction with web content.

The attribute offers supplementary details about the hyperlink's destination or purpose. This information typically appears as a tooltip, a small pop-up box,
 when the user hovers their mouse over the link, giving users a preview of what to expect before clicking. -->
    <p>Go to <a href="https://example.com/about" title="Visit our About section.">our website</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2>Turning Elements into Links</h2>    <!--To make an element clickable, you simply need to wrap the <a> tag around it. The href attribute within this tag defines the URL to which the link points.

This method works with a wide range of elements, including images, blocks of text, and even complex HTML structures like divs or sections. -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <img src="/uploads/media/default/0001/03/mountain_landscape.jpg" alt="Mountain landscape" width="340" height="250">

    <h1>Media</h1>

    <h2>Video and Audio Elements</h2>
    <!--HTML provides the <video> and <audio> elements for embedding these types of media in a web page.

    The elements support several attributes, such as:

    src for specifying the URL of the media file,
    controls for displaying built-in media controls,
    width and height for specifying the dimensions of the player,
    autoplay for automatically playing the media when the page loads,
    loop for looping playback, and
    preload for buffering the media file. -->
    <video src="myvideo.mp4" controls autoplay>
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>    <!--For example, the following code embeds a video with built-in media controls
         and automatic playback when the page loads: -->

    <h2>Ensuring Cross-Browser Compatibility</h2>
    <!--It's important to note that different browsers support different video and audio codecs,
     which can impact the compatibility of media content across various devices.

    To ensure cross-browser compatibility, it's recommended to provide multiple formats of the same media file, 
    such as MP4 and WebM for video, and MP3 and Ogg for audio. This can be achieved using the <source> element within the <video> and <audio> elements. -->
    <!-- Video Example -->
<video controls>
   <source src="myvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   <source src="myvideo.webm" type="video/webm">
   <p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
</video>

<!-- Audio Example -->
<audio controls>
   <source src="myaudiofile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
   <source src="myaudiofile.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
   <p>Your browser does not support the audio tag.</p>
</audio>

<h2>Responsive Videos</h2>    
<!--To create a responsive video using HTML, you can use the <video> element with the poster and controls attributes,
     and the <source> element with the media atribute.

The poster attribute specifies an image that will be displayed when the video is not playing, while the media attribute 
located within the <source> element specifies a maximum width for the video to be displayed. This allows the video to adapt to different screen sizes. -->
<video poster="web-dev-picture.jpg" controls>
  <source src="web-dev-video.mp4" type="video/mp4" media="(max-width: 600px)">
  <source src="web-dev-video.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
